Tiasa Nath,3.0,"The food is so-so. The service would've been good if only the waiters would not forget to bring what we asked even after we asked for it several times, and it was not rush hour. The restaurant was empty when we went there. The portion sizes for Pasta is very disappointing. Thin crust pizzas are tasty, but according to the price I think the pizza should have a little more meat in it.

Bina Soni,5.0,"We went as a whole family, about 12 of us, with kids ages 2 to 8 years old also. The Italian food they offered was excellent. We ordered a wide variety of different pizzas, pastas, and soup. The taste was really unique. The herbs they used were very fresh and tasted amazing. Overall, it was an excellent experience since the service they provided was also very good. I was amazed that it was also very centrally located,  near Tata Centre on Chowrangi Road close to Loretta College, in Kolkata, India.

Payel Banerjee,3.0,"The ambience was absolutely amazing but I'm a little disappointed with the pizza. I went there seeing amazing reviews but maybe it's because it was 9pm when we went - the waiter suggested we take half-half pizza but they'd take 10% extra of total prize . We agreed cause we were excited to taste the famous pizzas there. But after a long time , the pizza that came had a burnt hard crust. And the Doug looks pretty funny. To be precise I know thin crust should be little hard but it wasn't such , looked like last pizza they had made long ago , even wasn't hot + the price   We even informed and showed the food quality to the waiter, he agreed with us but didn't take any step further. Well it didn't satisfy the expectation . Rest good :) I might visit another time , just to confirm if that bad experience was one time thing or not.

Senjuti,5.0,"Located right next to the Maidan metro station, this is a beautifully decorated little restaurant in the heart of the city. Two of us comfortably shared the Fire of Bengal pizza, which I was initially skeptical about (mutton keema on pizza!) It turned out to be delightfully spicy, a wonderful combination of Bengali flavors and ingredients on a pizza. We also split a chocolate brownie for dessert and the combination was fantastic. Would highly recommend this restaurant. Food : 5/5   |   Service : 4/5   |   Atmosphere : 5/5 Food : 5/5   |   Service : 4/5   |   Atmosphere : 5/5 ",8 months ago
Tune with Food,4.0,"From the outside the appearance was appealing so we decided to go inside to look for the variety of choice this restaurant was offering. With our surprise we found that this restaurant has a lot of items in the menu, most items we never heard about it actually before  so we look into the menu and we found something that we can trust on it a bit which was Fire of Bengal; a pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy mutton, green chillies and fresh coriander leaves as a toppings. We are rating this pizza 4 star because we felt like the tomato sauce was less, and the quantity of mutton could be little bit more but have to say that the cheese was in a perfect amount. A little flavour can be enhanced. Pizza was of large size basically 8 pieces of them which was more than the capacity of our tummy, it is actually enough for 4 people. Overall ambience of the restaurant was quite and nice and we liked it.  we wish to visit there once again and would like to try more item's.",3 years ago
Subhrajit Barui,4.0,"This is my first visit to this place and I am pretty impressed with this place. This place has pretty good ambience. The seating area is quite big and has an open bar. You will get all kind of fusion based foods. I recommend to try their specialty pasta items. 1 pasta is good enough for 2 person. They also serve huge pizzas, risotto and other Italian items. If you are a vegetarian there is no need to be disappointed as they have vegan based foods as well. The price is little on higher side. However, the food quality is really really awesome. The cocktail section is also good and has lots of varieties. If you are going out with friends and planning for a quick bite, you must visit this place. The pocket pinch is approximately 1000 for two. A recommended place to visit.",a year ago

This place is probably the best Italian restaurant in Kolkata. I had the best pizza of my life ( till now ). Tried Risotto for the first time, which didn't disappoint. Octopus was also great. Only disappointment was that we couldn't try the gelato as the gelato machine was not functional. I hope they will fix it in time for our next visit!

Finally was able to order a salad that had salad material and tasted delicious. Pizza had fresh and tasty condiments and cheese was real. Cannot skip the margarita that was well needed and served beautifully. If you need a break from all the spice and need to be served napkins and utensils and be served with respect, this is a place to go. It is not a white table cloth service place, but it s own charm and the Movie posters On the walls with tasty food makes your money well spent. FYI it is on the pricey side.

ruchir gulati,4.0,"Excellent food - their range of antipasti and artisan pizzas are wonderful. The service was fairly quick and the food was superb. It was hot, flavors we're well balanced, and presentation was easy on the eyes. The place also has a good ambience. One thing that they could probably explore, looking at the trend of new pizza joints coming up across the city, is have a wood-fired oven. I have personally tried some of this fare and the smoky effect caused by the wood is beyond words! That said fire and ice still remains as one of the city's best Italian fine-dining restaurants.",5 years ago
Ishita Chatterjee,4.0,"Visited this place last month. It is surely a must visit place for all those who love Italian food. The place has a nice ambiance with courteous staff and beautifully decorated interior. It was a long day and we were not that hungry so we ordered only 2 dishes. 1. Fire of Bengal - This is among their recommended dishes, though I particularly did not like it that much. The pizza was kind of dry and it was constantly making me thirsty. But the concept is surely something new that I haven't tasted anywhere else before. It had Mutton keema, green chilies and lots of coriander leaves. Typical Bengali taste, on a thin crusted pizza. Quite innovative. 2. Pasta e Polpettine - It is basically Spaghetti with Meat Balls in tomato sauce. As one can understand it has a tangy taste to it and the meatballs are really well made. Wanted to try other varieties as well, but the pizza was too big and we were too full to try anything else. ",5 years ago

Sumit Pandey,5.0,"One of the best places to have Italian cuisine in Kolkata. I had a craving for authentic Italian food and the visit to fire and ice pizzeria was totally worth it. The restaurant is exquisite and suave. They have a diverse menu with good Italian dishes ranging from soups, starters, pizza, pasta, spaghetti, lasagnas and what not. They served the dishes and they all tasted amazing. They kept it in most authentic manner possible. The pizzas baked in wood ovens had great texture and taste. The mushroom soup was out of its league of soups very buttery and smooth. They serve pasta in two versions and both white sauce ariabatta and red sauce alfredo was superb. The vegetable lasagna was very cheesy and saucy. The flavour used and sauces and spices all were just superb. Though the prices are little over the par but the quality of food and genuine recipes make this place a treat. They also have a full functional bar with all good brands of liquor available. They have a mean apple pie and chocolate mousse cake as well. In total want to have a chilled out italian treat? Enter fire n ice pizzeria. ",5 years ago

Sanam Chauhan,1.0,"Google must have 0 star policy also !! I would have given a Zero rating to this spot. I ordered a lemonade, 12 inch pizza (Melanzane) and Aglio Olio. 1. Lemonade (Rs 140) : U will get one Cottons lemon drink (just like campa cola in North) in a bottle and one empty glass with straw and a slice of lemon. Therefore, u have to pay Rs 140 for a 25 rupee soft drink bottle. 2. Aglio Olio : Worst thing to try here it was just Yuck !!  Please don't try it here else u won't try Italiano ever in your life. (Wasted about rs 600-700) 3. Melanzane Pizza: Exorbitantly priced + in the name of Toppings u will get a very thin slice of capsicum. Please don't go by the Positive ReViews, it's a TRAP !! Instead if you visit there Do Try Russel Punjabi Dhaba :) Sardarji's Paratha, Lassi & Kesar Chai was just awesome 5/5.

Aayati Sengupta,3.0,"I've been going to Fire and Ice for the last ten years on again off again. One thing that has been consistently good is their pizza. However, a lot else has slipped through the cracks. Yesterday's visit was after quite a few years. There was a temperature check and hand sanitizing at the entrance. After which we were shown to our table. The place was relatively uncrowded (we had seen jampacked restaurants on our walk from Park Street to there) which was a bonus in my book because of the pandemic. However, I was disappointed to find that the salt and pepper shakers in our table as well as the next were empty; my ginger ale was served in a can without mint leaves even though I had specified that a couple of mint leaves be provided, and the chilli oil had clearly outlived its days. The bottle of chilli oil on our table had ancient chillies and their was no heat in the oil. That was also disappointing since I was introduced to good chilli oil for pizzas at Fire and Ice only. I hope that the establishment puts in a little bit of effort into getting the place back to its original days.

A Goel,1.0,"Atrocious service attitude. They focus only on groups and tables that have female guests. No attention on customers calling. Of course you are free to go to the counter and ask for attention yourself. They have lengthy explanations for food not tasting the way it should, Pasta arrabiata reeks of something sour. Lasagna tasted stale, with some pieces burnt! Portions are very small. Very low value for money. And this Italian food restaurant has no beer. Only expensive whiskies and wines. ",5 years ago

Matt Timoney,2.0,"Very expensive for what is just pizza.  Not bad pizza but not special either.  When you can get awesome steaks and burgers at much better establishments in Kolkata, for much less than a pizza here, it just isn't worth a visit.  Even an average sized bottle of water is 130 rupees which is almost 3 times the price at most other restaurants in the area.  The beer is ridiculously pricey.  If you want to pay through the nose for an average meal and drinks, then this is the place to come.  Check your bill as well, because, as usual, in this city, they will try to overcharge.  We were billed 780 for a pizza that on the menu was advertised at 680.",3 years ago

Aniruddha Bhattacharya,3.0,Again the 1 star is being deducted because you'll find the drinks and food slightly overpriced. They are one of the older pizzerias but need to work on a) their price of beverages and food b) the quality of dough on the pizza and c) there marinara sauce for the pizza. Have slightly deviated from their main Italian charm and have tried to tap into other cuisines.,2 years ago

The ambience is lovely, the have a fiar selection of wines and food and good music selection. The cons comes to service.. Primarily.. The water glasses smell of egg..not properly washed.. We ordered a penne  ""la saporita"", and we got a spaghetti.. On informing the head clerk about the confusion.. He reluctantly changed it. 3rd strike were the cocktails.. We ordered strawberry margheritas.. And one of which was bland on requesting to sweeten it.. The server said he would get us some sugar on the table. By then the ""right order"" came.. A hastily tossed penne without the side bread servings. On enquiry about the bread we were informed that the kitchen must have forgotten.. And we should have asked or reminded.. I honestly think f&i might be a good place but for it to be great.. The service could be a great deal better. Best wishes to it",4 years ago
Anil Kumar,2.0,Visited today again after long time. We used to visit here frequently. Prices gone up like crazy. Spirits also very expensive. Foccasia did not taste like before also was hard to chew.

Shalley Mohta,5.0,"This place is a little on the expensive side, but well worth it. They have a dish(whose name I do not remember and nor is it on the menu) which you can ask for by calling it 'potato chips/crisps'. They are literally the best different kind of potato chips I have eaten in a loooong time. We also ordered the grilled veg skewers and the mista salad. The salad was very refreshing, especially with the addition of feta. In mains, we ordered the asparagus risotto and the verdure pizza. Risotto was really bland and more like 'doodh bhaat' but the pizza made up for it. All in all, great food.

siddhant singhania,1.0,The food here is average at best and the service is abysmal. I had ordered a bloody Mary and the tomato juice tasted a little off. I had taken only one sip and the I requested them to change it. They took the drink and brought the same drink back without changing it. They just added a little more alcohol to it. When I asked them to change the drink they said that it was not in their policy. This is absolutely unacceptable that they don't correct their own mistakes,6 years ago

Fire N Ice to most Calcuttans screams comfort food and is easily at the top of the list when looking for Italian food. Starting with the appetiser platter all the way to the mousse and nutella crepes at the end, all the food is amazing. For first timers, I would suggest starting with the Rondelle crisps and the appetiser platter, followed by their famous Penne Arrabbiata if you like spicy food or the Penne in Pesto. Amongst their pizzas you can choose any from the long list available, arguably the best pizza in town. With dessert is where you're truly spoilt for choice. Their nutella crepes are top of the list followed closely by the chocolate mousse and their apple pie. Both of course, with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice-cream. Fire N Ice is one place with which you cannot go wrong. Also, don't forget to have a couple of glasses of their delicious homemade lemon iced-tea.",3 years ago
